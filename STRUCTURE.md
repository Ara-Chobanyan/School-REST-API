# Things we want in this REST api
- Create a table that takes in a dynamic name.
- Add/edit/delete data inside of the tables (add authentication for it maybe ?).
- Delete tables.
- Have the data in json format. 
- Read the data from json into the database.

# Back-end logic we need
- Take in a list of numbers.
- Calculate the average from the numbers taken.

# Future Plans (maybe)
- Perhaps create a front end with react, would give me a excuse to add user authentication.
